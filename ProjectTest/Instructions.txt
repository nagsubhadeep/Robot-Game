Welcome to the DragonMaze Guidelines

This Game is all about a world consisting of Grid and Actors of a Grid 
viz.. Hero, Dragon, Wall, Exit etc... 

H: Represents a Hero
D: Represents a Dragon
k: Represents a Key
E: Represents the Exit Door
e: Represents an Energy Drink
X: Represents a Wall

While moving in the grid, use the following options 

‘l’ to move left,
‘r’ to move right,
‘u’ to move up,
‘d’ to move down,
‘w’ to skip a turn,
‘q!’ to quit the maze.
As the player moves, the time increases.If the player collides with the Dragon,
or if the Dragon eats it, then the Game is Over. In order to win, the game has to be
completed within the timelimit. The player has to move in such a Way, so that
the Dragon would not be able to kill it, as the Dragon will keep on following
the player, whereever the player moves.

Once the player grabs the key, and passes through the Exit, the game ends successfully.
